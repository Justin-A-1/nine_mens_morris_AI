# nine_mens_morris_AI
Set of programs that uses MiniMax, Alpha-Beta Pruning, two different static estimations to play for white or black in a version of Nine Mens Morris

Use ABOpeningImp and ABGameImp for the best performance and best play (white or black either is fine)

To understand what this program is doing, see "game board.png", "AI Project 2.docx", look up Nine Men's Morris rules online, or reach out to me.
